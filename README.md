THIS PROJECT HAS SINCE BEEN DISCONTINUED AND MOVED TO A NEW REPO [HERE](https://github.com/BillyPurvis/Vue-Forms-Webpack).

Vue forms is a login/sign up form that works in stages, rather than being re-directed to completley seperate pages (although, it does use vue-router). Vue forms aims to create a desktop friendly 
login form, built with vue. The idea is to work in tandem with my Node API for user accounts (still in production). Upon successful login, the user is presented a welcome message and their profile 
(not included in the prototype). Or, the user can sign up. This is where the magic is. Using Vue's really awesome (and better than using SetInterval) two-way data binding, you can see
your profile card being populated as you go! No more hoping the formatting is okay, or having to click to see your own profile! You can create it and vue (pun intended) and once you're happy, save!

This project aimed to expand my knowledge with Javascript, vue and Node!
